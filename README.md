libressl-page
=============

In the spirit of absurd exercises, of forking a thing you don't like and have no control over, and of cleaning
up code, this is a quick refactor of the new LibreSSL home page that doesn't diminish from its unique flair.

I tried to maintain the spirit of the original, including:

* Features that annoy people (e.g., &lt;blink&gt; and Comic Sans)
* Not caring strongly about the formatting, and using tag defaults to determine basic styling

If you feel I've gone too far, please, fork and restore.  Don't expect honors of push requests, though.
We don't want help making web pages, thank you.

Incidentally, the guys working on LibreSSL rock so hard it makes me weep inside to know I'll never rock that hard.  There's also the fact that what they're doing could very well be the most important thing with respect to your privacy, ever.  You should [flip 'em a bill](http://www.openbsdfoundation.org/donations.html).  You know.  For science.
